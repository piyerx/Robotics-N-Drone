# Robotics & Drone Making - Training Codes 🚀

This repository contains all the codes and experiments done during my **Vocational Training on Robotics and Drone Making**. The training covers topics like **IoT devices, Arduino, ESP32, sensors, and robotics applications**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `Arduino/` → Codes related to Arduino projects.
* `ESP32/` → Codes and examples using ESP32.
* `Drone/` → Drone programming and control.

## 🛠️ Tools & Platforms

* **Arduino IDE**
* **PlatformIO**
* Basic IoT tools and libraries

## 📖 Learning Goals

* Understand and program microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32)
* Interface and use various sensors
* Implement IoT concepts in small projects
* Build simple robotics and drone applications

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repo is actively updated as I progress through the training.
